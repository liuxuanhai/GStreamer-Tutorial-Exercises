# About

This repository is a companion guide to the GStreamer Basic and Playback tutorials:

* https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/index.html
* https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/playback/index.html

It's split into two folders: `tutorial`, which contains the sample tutorial code; and the more interesting `exercise` folder, which contains the exercises that are assigned during the tutorial.

There are only 4 exercises: 3 from the "Basic" section, and 1 from the "Playback" section.

For each exercise in the `exercise` folder, there are 3 files:

1. The source code for the exercise (the solution)
2. A markdown file containing a) the exercise description b) an explanation of my solution
3. A screenshot showing what the final result of the exercise should look like
